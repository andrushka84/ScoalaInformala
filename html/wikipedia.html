            The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon.<sup>[3]</sup> Synonyms include Lycoperdon gemmatum (as described by August Batsch in 1783[4]); the variety Lycoperdon gemmatum var. perlatum (published by Elias Magnus Fries in 1829[5]); Lycoperdon bonordenii (George Edward Massee, 1887[6]); and Lycoperdon perlatum var. bonordenii (A.C. Perdeck, 1950[7]).[1][2]

L. perlatum is the type species of the genus Lycoperdon. Molecular analyses suggest a close phylogenetic relationship with L. marginatum.[8]

The specific epithet perlatum is Latin for "widespread".[9] It is commonly known as the common puffball, the gem-studded puffball[10] (or gemmed puffball[11]), the warted puffball,[9] or the devil's snuff-box;[12] Samuel Frederick Gray called it the pearly puff-ball in his 1821 work A Natural Arrangement of British Plants.[13] Because some indigenous peoples believed that the spores caused blindness, the puffball has some local names such as "blindman's bellows" and "no-eyes".[14]
